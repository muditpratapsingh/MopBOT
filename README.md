# “MopBot”- A wall cleaning Robot.
This is life saving idea. this project "BOT" all about to Mopping Skyscraper Building glasses.
# Description of MopBot:-
There are large numbers of high-rise buildings with glass curtain walls that require constant cleaning and is carried out using permanent gondola systems. This is a laborious and dangerous work. Due to a lack of uniform building structure, wall cleaning and maintenance of high-rise buildings is becoming one of the most appropriate fields for robotization. The development of mopbot project offers an alternative solution to glass-wall cleaning. 
Application of this type of cleaning robotic system can free workers from this hazardous work and realize an automatic cleaning of high-rise buildings, thereby improving the technological level and productivity of the service industry. That’s not Spiderman you see climbing the outside of a high-rise building, it's a robot specially designed to tackle skyscrapers' dirty windows. 
This equipped with sensors and propellers, the robot is able to withstand height about 50 meter scale when it works on high-rise buildings. Its weight is 1.1 kilogram and can hold the weight about 2.5 kilogram. About 10 times more efficient than manual window washers, the robot can work continuously for four hours and clean 120 square meters of glass wall per hour mopbot introduces a smaller, more affordable automated window and building washing solution for window cleaning services and commercial building owners so it just help the cleaning problem of glasses of large building. So mopbot is a glass cleaning robot designed for single side cleaning on mirrors, walls, windows and more. Mopbot automatically clean outdoor of high building safely and economically.
